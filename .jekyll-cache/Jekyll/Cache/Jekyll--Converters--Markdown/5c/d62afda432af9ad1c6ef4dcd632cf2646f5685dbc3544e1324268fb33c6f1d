I"9<p>Humans spend money on a daily basis, be it for shopping, basic necessities, or even for the occasional getaway trip out of town. Money comes in many forms - a metal coin, a piece of paper or even a string of code electronically mined by a computer. But what gives money its value? Who defines and control the value and supply of money? Does it really have any intrinsic value? To understand this, letâ€™s dive right into the history of modern money.</p>

<p>##The History of Modern Money
<br />
In the olden days of traditional monetary policy, the supply of money within an economy was fixed. Back then, money was in the form of precious metals, and the only way to get money is the work for it (literally mine the precious metals) or sell something valuable in exchange for it.</p>

<p>This leads to a proportional relationship between the value of money and economic goods and services - as economic output increases, the value of money increases.</p>

<p>Eventually, it was decided that using heavy precious metals as a store of wealth/means of economic activity is far too inconvenient. Banks started existing and took care of the precious metals for you, in exchange for a piece of paper, which is universally known as <strong>fiat money</strong>.</p>
