I"¸<p>Humans spend money on a daily basis, be it for shopping, basic necessities, or even for the occasional getaway trip out of town. Money comes in many forms - a metal coin, a piece of paper or even a string of code electronically mined by a computer. But what gives money its value? Who defines and control the value and supply of money? Does it really have any intrinsic value? To understand this, let‚Äôs dive right into the history of modern money.</p>

<h4 id="the-history-of-modern-money"><strong>The History of Modern Money</strong></h4>
<p>In the olden days of traditional monetary policy, the supply of money within an economy was fixed. Back then, money was in the form of precious metals, and the only way to get money is the work for it (literally mine the precious metals) or sell something valuable in exchange for it.</p>

<p>This leads to a proportional relationship between the value of money and economic goods and services - as economic output increases, the value of money increases.</p>

<p>Eventually, it was decided that using heavy precious metals as a store of wealth/means of economic activity is far too inconvenient. Banks started existing and took care of the precious metals for you, in exchange for a piece of paper, which is universally known as <strong>fiat money</strong>.</p>

<p>Slowly, the general population got accustomed to the use of fiat paper money in their daily lives. Since fiat currency were societally accepted, virtually nobody returned to the banks to redeem their precious metals (hereon refered to as ‚Äúgold‚Äù). The banks, responsible for storing gold for people safely, came up with an idea of lending these gold out, while profitting from a set interest rate. <strong>Here‚Äôs the catch</strong>: the gold being lent out into the economy were <em>already in circulation</em> given that they were initially stored in the banks in exchange for fiat money. Money was pretty much being created in the economy of thin air!</p>

<p>This ultimately lead to more money being pumped into circulation, which lead to an increase in the supply of money, an increase in economic output and an increase in the price of goods and services. Due to the supply of money not being constant anymore, the value of money essentially becomes <em>diluted</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, with an increase of demand towards goods and services (due to more money in circulation), their prices will naturally increase too. This gives people a false impression that they are getting richer as the prices of their assets are increasing in value, but in fact, what is really happening is <strong>inflation</strong>. At some point, borrowing became expensive, and people in debt rely on their savings to pay back the loans they owe the banks. Some people would have to default on their assets, causing them to be liquidated, which ultimately leads to a <strong>recession</strong>.</p>
