I"¿<p>Back when I first hit 18, I was immediately reminded eagerly by my dad that I would finally be eligible to volunteer as a blood donor. Being someone who religiously donated his own blood every 2-3 months from a youthful age of 18 (note that he is over 50 now and has barely missed a single donation), he attests that because of his habitual routine, he has managed to stay healthy enough to circumvent any common age-related health issues.</p>
